* Purpose
This is as attempt at finally producing a usable desktop OS for my personal use.

* Choice of technologies
- OS: [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] (see [[https://github.com/albins/nixpkgs][my efforts to make packages]])
- Desktop: Gnome (or Mate if I really have to, anything but the ugly german DE)

* Long-term goals and priorities
- Unit tests for system functionality
- Freedom of /choice/ was the wrong freedom
- Develop and test systems as, well, systems, not kernel plus packages
- Declarative Is Good
- Stability and maintainability over features
- A good UI takes clever functionality every single time
- The 70's are over
- Harmony of function and form â€“ all programs should, where possible, look, feel and work similarly
